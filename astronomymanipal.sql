(1, 'Comets', 'Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that orbit the Sun.', 'Aditya Khatavkar', '\r\n<p>Comets, or \\\"dirty snowballs\\\", unlike any other celestial body were unpredictable to the ancient astronomers. Thus they came to be thought of as a sign from the gods. Some perceived it as a sword foretelling war while others saw it as a woman with long hair, conveying the sorrow of the gods. Many civilizations saw comets as a bad omen. However, though Chinese astronomers considered comets to be bad, they kept track of the comets, enabling future astronomers to determine their true nature.</p>\r\n<p>We now know that comets are leftovers from the dawn of our solar system around 4.6 billion years ago, and consist mostly of ice, coated with dark organic material. They may yield important clues about the formation of our solar system. Comets may have brought water and organic compounds, the building blocks of life, to the early Earth and to other parts of the solar system (Lithopanspermia).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Comets are thought to originate in two places, namely, the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. The Kuiper Belt is a circular disc extending from the orbit of Neptune (30-50 AU). Though the Kuiper Belt is named after Gerard Kuiper, a Dutch-American astronomer and planetary scientist, it was first hypothesized by Fredrick C. Leonard, an American astronomer at the University of California. Short-period or periodic comets have orbital periods of less than 200 years, though sometimes, they have longer orbital periods. These comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper Belt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Oort Cloud is a theoretical cloud of icy planetisimals, first hypothesized by Jan Oort, proposed to surround the sun to as far as 0.8 to 3.2 light years (50,000 to 2,00,000 AU). The outer limit of Oort Cloud defines the boundary of the solar system and the extent of the Sun\\\'s Hill sphere, defined as the region within which an astronomical body can attract satellites. It is divided into two parts - the disc-shaped inner Oort Cloud or the Hill\\\'s Cloud and a spherical outer Oort Cloud. The outer Oort Cloud, being loosely bound to the solar system, is affected by the gravitational forces of passing by stars and the milky way itself. This causes comets to get dislodged and come to the inner solar system.</p>\r\n<p>Comets have several distinct parts, namely, a nucleus, a coma, a hydrogen cloud, a dust tail, and an ion tail. The nucleus is the relatively solid and stable part of the comet, composed mainly of ice and gas. As the comet gets nearer to the sun, the nucleus melts to form water and gases like carbon dioxide, which then make up the coma. The hydrogen cloud is a huge but very sparse envelope of neutral hydrogen. It is millions of kilometres in diameter. The dust tail is primarily composed of smoke-like dust particles, driven off by escaping gases from the nucleus of the comet. It can be up to 10 million kilometres long, prominent to the unaided eye. The ion tail is several hundred million kilometres long, formed by plasma and laced with rays and streamers, caused by solar wind. Since most of the parts become visible due to vicinity to the sun, comets are mostly invisible when not nearby the sun.</p>\r\n<p>Comets that pass extremely close to the sun are called sun-grazing comets. Many sun-grazing comets break up due to the gravity of the sun or evaporate due to its heat. However, the few that survive perihelion are important in the study of the sun and the solar corona. ISON, observed in 2012, and thought to be the comet of the century, was a sun-grazing comet which broke up during its perihelion.</p>\r\n<p>Comets are named in different ways. The simplest way is by the year, for example, the Great Comet of 1680. Sometimes they also have suffixes like 1969i or 1970 II, where 1969i indicates the ninth comet discovered in the year 1969, and 1970 II indicates the second comet to pass perihelion in 1970 (this was after the orbit was established). They are named after people, investigators, discoverers, such as in the cases of Caesar\\\'s comet, Halley\\\'s comet, comet Faye, etc. To make the naming system consistent, the IAU designed a system in 1994 which uses various prefixes to denote the nature of the comet and suffixes to denote the year, half month and the number of comets discovered in that half month. Halley\\\'s comet is denoted by 1P/1682 Q1, meaning, it is the first periodic comet that was discovered in the first half of September in 1682.</p>\r\n<p>Comets are now a well-known phenomenon, especially in popular culture. The most well-known comet is the Halley\\\'s Comet, named after English astronomer Edmond Halley, who discovered its periodicity in 1705. It is a short-period comet appearing every 74-79 years. It was the first comet which was discovered to be periodic. Halley continued Newton\\\'s work on comets and concluded that orbital elements of a second comet observed in 1682 were the same as those of two comets observed in 1531 by Petrus Apianus and in 1607 observed by Johannes Kepler. Last observed in 1986, the Halley\\\'s comet is expected to appear next in 2061.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>--References--</p>\r\n<p>NASA</p>\r\n<p>Wikipedia</p>\r\n<p>UCLA.edu</p>\r\n<p>Space.com</p>\r\n<p>NinePlanets.org</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>', '01-01.png;', '2019-10-06 03:09:56', '2019-10-06'),
(2, 'Dark Energy', 'A theoretical form of energy postulated to act in opposition to gravity and to occupy the entire universe, accounting for most of the energy in it and causing its expansion to accelerate.', 'Archit Dasgupta', '<p>In literature the word dark is often used to describe something evil so the first time I heard of the words dark energy I thought it was related to dark magic maybe it was something that evil magicians use to power themselves up when they are tired or exhausted or they use when they are about to fight someone!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But later I understood that in science the word dark is interpreted as its literal meaning. So the word dark in science means something that cannot be seen and hence cannot be properly understood, hence in science if the word dark is added in front of anything it means that thing is more mysterious than evil. So dark energy is no way related to dark magic, evil magicians or voodoo priests. However, is equally mysterious and interesting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before we understand what is dark energy we need to go back to the beginning of time itself the moment when our universe was born. \\\"<em>As it all started with the big bang(bang!)\\\".</em></p>\r\n<p>For many centuries we were looking for the answer of how our universe came into existence in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;So people came up with theories which would explain how the universe with all its planets stars and galaxies came into existence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The most popular which was accepted by almost everyone was that god created the universe and everything in it this was a widely accepted theory as all the significant religious powerhouses supported this and also it was easy to understand. However,many people saw the ambiguity in this theory&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\\\"if God created everything who created God?\\\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\\\" how did he create it?\\\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, those who asked these questions were suppressed by the powerful religious strongholds and they were severely punished and sometimes even sentenced to death. &nbsp; However, as time passed many began to the realize the problems in this theory forced upon them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hence began the search for better explanations of how the universe came into existence. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century there were 2 other theories gaining popularity one was known as the <strong><u>steady state theory</u></strong> and other was known as <strong><u>the big bang theory</u></strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The steady state theory which was more widely accepted by prominent scientists and astrophysicists like Albert Einstein, stated that the universe had to be static, i.e it could never expand nor could it contract it had to be in a steady state forever. Such was the popularity of this theory that Einstein even changed his theory of relativity by introducing a cosmological constant into his equations (we will come back to this latter).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;However, in 1929 a man named Edwin Hubble discovered that most galaxies appeared red shifted; meaning that they were moving away from us and also the farther away the galaxies were the more was the red shift. This was one of the most important discoveries in the field of astrophysics he had proof that the universe was not steady but static in nature and is constantly expanding. Hence, ruled out the possibility of a steady universe.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now people started coming up with a new theory the theory which is widely accepted till date <strong><u>\'the big bang theory\'</u></strong>; scientists came to the conclusion that if the universe is expanding now then there was a time where the universe must have had lesser volume, volume so low that the entire mass of the universe was concentrated into a single infinitely small point known as a <strong>singularity</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The time our universe was a extremely small point was found out to be 13.8 billions years ago. That was considered to be the beginning of time and our universe. The expansion that followed was known as the big bang. &nbsp;All our laws of physics come into existence after the big bang. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After Hubble\'s discovery it was assumed that the universe was expanding slowly and one day the gravitational forces will overcome the force of expansion and the universe would contract back into a singularity. Hence the universe would end the way it began this was known as <strong><u>\'the big crunch\'</u></strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, observations by astrophysicists around the late 20<sup>th</sup> century led to the discovery of something strange!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A group of astrophysicists were trying to find the deceleration of a distant supernovae in space but instead observed that the supernovae wasn\'t decelerating but actually moving away from us at an accelerated pace! Various other astrophysicists verified this observation &nbsp;and repeated the experiments and found out that the rate of universe expansion kept increasing as time went on. So unlike popular opinion the expansion of the universe was not slowing down it was speeding up!!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now Scientists were searching for a reason as to why the expansion of the universe of speeding up what was this invisible force of energy causing this acceleration?</p>\r\n<p>They called this unknown mysterious source of energy <strong><u>Dark Energy</u></strong>, which was responsible for the accelerated expansion of our universe.</p>\r\n<p>In 2013 due to readings of a European space observatory which mapped the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background at microwave and infra-red frequencies, gave an estimate that the universe is made up of 68.3% dark energy. <strong><em>There is still very little known about dark energy many even consider dark energy to be an intrinsic property of empty space,</em></strong> that is causing the universe to expand at such rates, dark energy is considered to be made up of particles and occurs in clumps held together by its own gravitational energy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are two ways of understanding the nature of Dark Energy, one is Dark energy as a cosmological constant and the other is Dark Energy as quintessence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>DARK ENERGY AS A COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT:--</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Let\'s come back to the time when Einstein was a static universe fan and was tweaking his theories that would lead to a static universe and found a cosmological constant that effectively cancelled out gravity and the chances of a dynamic universe. <strong><em>Maybe this cosmological constant is dark energy which is overcoming gravity to avoid the eventual contraction of this universe.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For dark energy to be responsible for the constant accelerated expansion of the universe it should have negative pressure (pressure and volume are inversely proportional one decreases the other increases so if the pressure is negative it is doing work on the environment hence volume increases) which is equal to its energy density.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The only disadvantage of considering dark energy as a cosmological constant is the quantum field theories predict a huge contrast in observed and theoretical values of this cosmological constant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also theories that link gravity to other fundamental forces of nature require a cosmological constant equal to exactly 0 so for dark energy to be a cosmological constant these theories have to be broken which is not possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Despite these problems the theory of dark energy as a cosmological constant is the most widely accepted theory as it is simple and easy to understand and there is also a natural explanation for its origin. (many quantum theories predict vacuums fluctuations\' that can give vacuum this kind of energy)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>DARK ENERGY AS QUINTESSENCE:--</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>However, there is another possible way to explain dark energy known as <strong><em>quintessence</em></strong> this is a hypothetical form of dark energy that is dynamic in nature i.e. unlike the cosmological constant which is a \'constant\' it says that dark energy changes over time and space so it can be either attractive or repulsive, as it explains dark energy to be dynamic in nature so it gets rid of the problems that arise when dark energy was considered as a constant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This theory suggests that dark energy might have originated from temporary changes in the amount of total energy in various points in space, and are limited by the event horizon of the universe.</p>\r\n<p>However, there is still no evidence of quintessence found and is completely theoretical. A special form of quintessence is phantom energy that have negative kinetic energy and cause the expansion to accelerate to an infinite amount in a finite time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>CONSEQUENCES OF DARK ENERGY:--</u></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Now the question arises that how is dark energy effecting our universe.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If we consider dark energy as a cosmological constant, then it predicts that the universe will continue to expand indefinitely and this would lead to our neighboring galaxies to move away from us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They would continue to be redshifted from us until the wavelengths cannot be detected anymore and they would seem to vanish into oblivion, but in reality move away from us with speeds faster than light. The milky way or all other galaxies as a whole will be undisturbed but would eventually die of heat death (temperature differences can no longer be used to perform work). &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In simple terms all the galaxies would be so far away that they would seem to be alone in the entire universe and due to huge temperature differences (and loneliness&nbsp;L) they would die.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If we consider the quintessence theory and the presence of phantom energy. Then in the future dark energy should be the only dominant force left in the universe and would tear apart all gravitationally bound structures and also overcome electrical and nuclear forces that would cause the tearing up of atoms themselves!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Hence ending the universe by ripping it apart (the big rip)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Or maybe dark energy may become attractive in nature in the future and gravity would start to dominate the universe and cause the universe to contract back into a singularity (the big crunch)</p>\r\n<p>Or the future may be a little more optimistic and the universe stays as it is forever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The optimism doesn\'t stop here all these events are supposed to happen after billions of year and by that time we would all be long gone to see how exactly the universe ended (or will we?)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Dark energy is still mysterious and unknown and hence is a hot topic of research maybe in the following years our understanding on this topic would improve, maybe someday some astrophysicist would find something peculiar up there that would explain everything.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>As the writers of the all-time classic movie Mr X wrote:--&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>\"THE MORE WE EXPLORE THE MARVELS OF THIS UNIVERSE THE MORE WE COME TO KNOW THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT\"</em></strong></p>', '02-01.png;', '2019-10-02 02:54:03', '2019-10-02'),
(3, 'Aliens: Real or Fable', 'Are aliens real or just a fable?', 'Anony', '<p>Do aliens exist? This question has mystified humans ever since prehistoric man noticed the bright stars in our sky. There are around 200 billion galaxies out there and rational people estimate around 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets overall. So are we really the only planet with intelligent (again, debatable) life on it?</p>\r\n<p>We have been fascinated by the bizarre, and alien sightings are top on that list. From extraterrestrials taking over the world, to government conspiracies, many experienced scientists have tried explaining such events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here are a few popular \\\'close encounters of the third kind\\\':</p>\r\n<p>The most popular one is the Roswell incident which occurred in 1947 where, Rancher William Brazel discovered mysterious debris in one of his pastures. News headlines claimed that a \\\"flying saucer\\\" crashed in Roswell, but military officials claimed that it was merely a conventional weather balloon. Interest subsequently weakened until the late 1970s, when ufo-logists began promoting a variety of increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories, claiming that one or more alien spaceships had crash-landed, and that the extraterrestrial occupants had been recovered by the military, who then engaged in a cover-up.</p>\r\n<p>In the 1990s, the US military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed object: a nuclear test surveillance balloon from Project Mogul. Nevertheless, this incident continues to be of interest in popular media, and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist. Roswell has been described as \\\"the world\\\'s most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim\\\".</p>\r\n<p>The UFO mania was first set up by an incident which occurred earlier that year with Kenneth Arnold who claimed to see 9 blue glowing objects flying in a \\\'V\\\' formation approximately at a speed of 2700kmph, which was three times faster than any manned aircraft in 1947. &nbsp;When he described their motion as similar to \\\"a saucer if you skip it across water,\\\" the media coined the now-universal phrase \\\"flying saucer.\\\" Soon, there were other reports of a group of nine UFOs across the region, including sightings by a prospector on Mount Adams and the crew of a commercial flight in Idaho. The government never had a true explanation for the sightings-it simply claimed that Arnold had seen a mirage or was hallucinating.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Almost all sightings have a similar explanation which is never satisfying. I personally very much believe that aliens exist and the government surely has a lot which has been covered up. For the past 44 years the National UFO Reporting Center has been taking a sincere effort of recording occurrences like these. Right now, they receive between 10-20 written reports in a day through the website, but the number of sightings is going up. A majority of the explanations provided by the governments fail in convincing that the event wasn\\\'t something \\\'out of the ordinary\\\'. The most reliable reports involve multiple witnesses who corroborate each other\\\'s sightings. NUFORC believes serving as a listening ear is one half of the job, presenting those stories as publicly-available reports is the other. The director, Peter Davenport feels, people should have access to information about extraterrestrial activity, \\\"without having to rely on a government which is lying to all of us about the UFO phenomenon\\\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another incident which was very poorly explained by the government is The Lubbock Lights which occurred in 1951. &nbsp;Three science professors from Texas Tech were enjoying an evening outdoors in Lubbock. Suddenly they noticed a semicircle of lights flying above them at a very high speed. Over the next few days, dozens of reports flooded in from across town. Newspapers across the country and Life magazine also published photos of the incident snapped by a Texas Tech freshman, named Carl Hart Jr. Dr. Grayson Mead claimed that the lights \\\"appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate and they were greenish-blue, slightly fluorescent in color. They were smaller than the full moon at the horizon. There were about a dozen to fifteen of these lights, they were absolutely circular, it gave all of us an extremely eerie feeling.\\\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Air Force initially believed the lights were caused by a type of bird called a plover, but later on concluded that the lights \\\"weren\\\'t birds but they weren\\\'t spaceships either, the Lubbock Lights have been positively identified as a very commonplace and easily explainable natural phenomenon.\\\" However, the Air Force refused to provide any details because apparently, they had to \\\"maintain the anonymity\\\" of the scientist who had provided the explanation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Tehran incident of 1976 is one of my favourites. It started with phone calls from concerned citizens reporting a bright light in the sky. An F-4 fighter jet was sent to investigate. The pilot was forced to return to the base as its instruments blacked out while it neared the object. A second F-4 took its place, and as it neared the unusual light, it achieved radar lock. According to the pilot, the UFO released a glowing object which the pilot assumed it to be some sort of missile headed straight for him. As the pilot prepared to retaliate, his aircraft started experiencing malfunctions, and he saw another bright object released from the UFO which headed straight toward the ground. Helpless, he decided to safely return to base. The US government upon investigation, came up with explanations for the entire incident. They believed the bright light might have been caused by a clear view of Jupiter and as the F4 jets had been having problems since their inception, the malfunctions pretty common. The radar lock could\\\'ve been a result of the same. The first F-4, was never turned in for maintenance following the incident, despite an event that would need a check according to protocol. As a result, there\\\'s no proof of the technical failures, and so the sightings of the UFO releasing glowing objects were accounted for by meteor showers.</p>\r\n<p>Since then there have been many sightings all over the world. In 1957, people in Levelland, Texas reported seeing a rocket or strange lights that interfered with their vehicles and machines, along with power cuts. The UFO research group claimed that the power cuts were caused by thunderstorms, whereas weather reports proved otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 1980, two incidents occurred. One was at Rendlesham forest where members of the US air force reported strange, colourful lights. A man who went to investigate, claimed that he saw a spacecraft. The next day, others confirmed damage to nearby trees and higher-than-normal level radiation. More sightings were reported in the next several days. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt recorded his observations on an audio tape as he watched the tried to observe the lights. The other incident was called the Belgium Wave where citizens reported seeing a large triangular UFO hovering in the sky. A few months later, there were sightings of multiple objects and two F-16 fighter jets were sent out to investigate. The reported UFOs were so fast that the pilots ended up losing them even with radar lock. Some 13,500 people are estimated to have witnessed this incident. In both the cases, UK\\\'s Ministry of Defense ended up concluding that the incident neither was a hostile or aggressive one nor did it provide any threat to the nation, thereby terminating the investigation.</p>\r\n<p>The countless theories based on reported sightings and events were disproved by what seem like beautifully timed coincidences provided by the governments and their agencies. As we proceed with technological advancements, it becomes easier to give reasonable explanations for such UFO sightings. Now, whether these incidents are cover ups or not, is extremely debatable. UFOlogists claim they\\\'re cover ups, governments disagree, and Neil Degrasse Tyson says there\\\'s 50 more years till we interact with complex life from space. Whatever the case, the coincidences are too precise to be true. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>', '03-01.png;', '2019-10-06 02:47:51', '2019-10-06'),
(4, 'History of the Universe', 'This article explains the history of our universe.', 'Anony', '<p><strong><u>13.8 billion years ago</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>(This is pure theory, nothing experimentally proven)</p>\r\n<p>The Big Bang. But it wasn\\\'t really a bang. NASA instead says that the Big Bang was the simultaneous appearance of space everywhere in the universe. Since so much confusion occurred in a matter of seconds, we take a really small unit of time called planck time denoted by tp i.e. 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The planck epoch</strong> is basically the time before 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds. The physics of this period are shaky at best and the quantum effects of gravity mostly dominated the physics of this time. Not much is understood except that the temperature was so high that all the forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong and weak nuclear forces - called as electronuclear force) were one fundamental force. Many theories have been put forth but there is no effective way of testing these at present.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Grand Unification epoch:&nbsp;</strong>Between 10<sup>-43</sup> and 10<sup>-36</sup> seconds, the universe starts cooling down. Gravity as a force, separates from the electronuclear forces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>The electroweak epoch</strong>: Between 10<sup>-36</sup> and 10<sup>-32</sup> seconds, as the temperature reduced, the strong nuclear force became distinct from the electroweak force (which may have fueled inflation).</p>\r\n<p><strong>The inflationary epoch:&nbsp;</strong>After 10<sup>-32</sup> seconds, the universe continued to decrease in density and temperature. In this period, rapid expansion took place driven by a hypothetical inflation field (having properties similar to dark energy) which supposedly drove cosmic inflation in the early universe</p>\r\n<p>Once inflation ended (around 10<sup>-12</sup> seconds), the temperature started increasing, returning to pre-inflation temperature. The potential energy of the inflation field decays into standard particles like quarks, leptons and bosons.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Quark epoch:&nbsp;</strong>The quark epoch begins after 10<sup>-12</sup> seconds. The universe is filled with quark-gluon plasma and electromagnetic radiation. The four fundamental forces operate distinctly now.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hadron epoch:&nbsp;</strong>After around 10<sup>-6</sup> seconds, the temperature reduces enough for quarks to bind with each other to form hadrons. Particle and anti-particle pairs of all kinds kept getting created or destroyed. Then something weird happens (or doesn\\\'t) - Baryogenesis is the process that produced more matter than antimatter (The science behind it is super complicated). This process is again, just a conjecture since it requires perfect conditions to be met and a lot of mathematics too. Till now though, there is no concrete answer as to why there\\\'s more matter than antimatter in the universe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;From here on till 10 seconds after the big bang, the quark gluon plasma starts cooling, forming lepton/anti-lepton pairs. This is also called the <strong>lepton epoch.</strong> As the temperature further cooled, these annihilated themselves leaving behind a small residue of hadrons and leptons (again, we don\\\'t know how).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Photon epoch:&nbsp;</strong>10 seconds after the big bang, photons dominated the energy of the universe for the next 370,000 years. During this period, around 3 minutes after the big bang, the temperature of the universe falls to a point (a billion kelvin and the density was about that of air) where atomic nuclei begin to form. This was called <strong>nucleosynthesis.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>After the photon epoch, nuclear fusion takes place and deuterium is formed. This deuterium fuses into a helium - 4 nucleus (not our usual helium). After 377,000 years, the universe was cool enough to make protons and electrons bind to form the first electrically neutral hydrogen atoms. After this, photons no longer interacted with matter. These photons got decoupled from matter and travelled freely through the universe which is now said to be <strong>cosmic microwave background radiation.</strong> Presently, if you point a sensitive radio telescope towards a dark spot in the sky, the telescope would show a faint flow which is really uniform. This glow isn\\\'t associated with any star, galaxy or any other object and its strongest in the microwave region of the spectrum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>13.6 billion years ago:</u></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Dark Ages:&nbsp;</strong>This lasted from 380,000 years after the big bang and completely ended 150 million years later. After the photons decoupled, the universe became transparent, converting a foggy universe to an empty universe which looked like one giant void. The temperature of the universe cooled down to about 60K.</p>\r\n<p>At a 100 million years after the big bang, gravity pulls ordinary matter into structures created by dark matter. Smaller stars begin to form as reionization starts. The intense radiation emitted from the formation of these early stars ionizes the rest of the universe, which consisted mostly of plasma. These stars fused hydrogen to produce helium. At 300 million years these stars consisting purely of hydrogen and helium were forced to fuse helium over time to produce carbon, oxygen, silicon all the way up to iron. The first large scale structures like protogalaxies and nebulae are formed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Renaissance:&nbsp;</strong>At 600 million years after the big bang, the Dark ages end as there is light throughout the universe. Mass star formation happens and the universe starts to heat up once again. At 700 million years, galaxies begin to form. Smaller galaxies merge to form bigger ones, and different types of galaxies arise. This is the possible time period at which the Milky Way would\\\'ve formed but it\\\'s still not confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Galaxy epoch:&nbsp;</strong>At one billion years after the big bang, the reionization era ends. Galaxies form at a high rate. 1.1 billion years later the oldest observed extrasolar planet is formed orbiting a pulsar and a white dwarf. 5 billion years after the big bang, the earliest population of sunlike stars form (basically stars with a high level of heavy elements). These stars produce planetary nebulae in which rocky substances form and combine, leading to the formation of terrestrial planets, comets and so on. A 100 million years later, a galaxy collides with the milky way forming the spiral arms of our galaxy leading to a major period of star formation. After that the rate of star formation stabilizes.</p>\r\n<p>6 billion years after the big bang, the universe continues to organize into larger, wider structures. Super structures like massive galaxy clusters form and the universe becomes more modern looking. A billion years later, the growth of large galaxies begin to slow and the temperature cools below 5K.</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>6 billion years ago&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Acceleration:&nbsp;</strong>Following the matter dominated era of the galaxy, dark energy starts to overtake gravity and the universe\\\'s expansion rate starts to accelerate. This is the last of the three phases of the universe, the first two being the radiation dominated era and the matter dominated era. The effect of dark energy increases in this period mainly due to the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, gravity loses its effect on keeping everything together and dark energy starts to relatively dominate, accelerating the expansion of the universe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Solar System:&nbsp;</strong>9 billion years after the big bang, a cloud of hydrogen began to collapse to form our sun as well as a surrounding acceleration disk. 232 million years later, the 4 gas giants form and 25 million years later a solar system of 8 planets revolves around the sun along with smaller planets. Because of conflicting orbits of the smaller planets, the bombardment of the planets start. 9 million years after that, the moon is formed after impact from a planet (hypothetical). The moon eventually stabilizes the earth\\\'s fluctuating axis. Another 40 million years later and the Oort cloud and Kupier Belt are formed. Comets bring water to Mars and Earth. &nbsp;And finally 700 million years later, 3.8 billion years ago, the first traces of life appear on earth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>', '04-01.png;', '2019-10-06 03:38:45', '2019-10-06'),
(5, 'Mars', 'About Mars colonization', 'Anony', '<p>Mars, named after the roman god of war, has captured our imagination since time immemorial. It is the fourth planet in terms of solar distance in our system of planets. Mars, along with earth, lies in the \\\"habitable\\\" zone, where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold, a so called goldilocks zone where scientists believe life can survive and evolve. As a matter of fact some astronomers even believe that a couple billion years ago, mar might have actually been hot enough to support liquid water on its surface, and hence be a haven for life. Another theory, spawning from the billions of tons of mars rocks found on earth, suggests that one of those rocks might actually have carried life from a fertile mars to a then barren earth, giving birth to life as we know it on our planet, a phenomenon called \\\"Panspermia\\\".</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Besides being the right temperature, mars also has a similar to earth 25 hour day, similar size and hence similar gravity, which further strengthens the belief that mars is indeed a more interesting neighbor than we ever thought.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is therefore natural for us to be curious about the possibility of life on the planet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1961. President Kennedy declares that we will put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. 1969. Neil Armstrong takes a giant leap for mankind. That mission inspired an entire generation of astronomers, scientists and engineers to take some of the most daring efforts in scientific development which gave rise to the technology we have today and which we take for granted.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But in the last few years, there has been a stagnancy in the vigor with which we were raring to explore space. As a matter of fact, no man has left the lower earth orbit since 1972! One of the reasons being the cost. The cost estimated by the NASA for sending a manned mission to mars in the late 1980s was $450 billion. The plan was to build the ISS three times as big as it is as of now, a base on the moon where a moon crew would build a spaceship for mars and then launch to mars from the moon. This report, called the 90 day report was immediately scrapped owing to the huge cost of the project.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Robert Zubrin, a young aerospace engineer, who was himself inspired by the Apollo missions, was left devastated when he learnt that the NASA would not be exploring anywhere beyond the moon anytime soon. He started gathering support for his cause, came up with a plan to launch a manned mission to mars directly from earth, not within the next 30 years, not 20 years, but within a span of 10 years. He came up with a simpler idea than NASA of building two spaceships, one unmanned, and one manned, the first of which will be launched first, will reach the moon and using the abundant co2 in the mars\\\' atmosphere and the water underneath the Martian surface (permafrost), will start manufacturing fuel for the return trip of the second mission. The second manned spaceship will be launched two years after the unmanned one, and which will be an ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), where highly trained astronauts would set foot on the red planet, collect vital data, and become heroes of the next generation of engineers. His plan was named Mars direct, and found widespread support from the Apollo community who found his ideas much simpler than NASA\\\'s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Zubrin\\\'s plan had an estimated cost of $55billion distributed over 10 years, way less than NASA\\\'s budget ($17 billion per annum), yet it found widespread discontent amongst the administration since it cut off its role during the course of its mission.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 2000, Bush administration announced the renewal of the moon mission by 2020. It was scrapped in 2010 owing to the lack of \\\'funds\\\'. In 2010, president Obama vowed to put a man back on the moon by 2030 and on mars by 2040. These are all plans which extend way beyond the terms that presidents serve and hence get cancelled as soon as another man comes into office.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Mars one is another organization which intends to send humans to a one way journey the red planet, but the viability of that plan is under immense scrutiny from the scientific community.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>China, Russia, the Europe and the ISRO and all next in ranks for space research. In fact, India made a strong impact in the space race by launching the mars orbiter mission last year. Private organizations like the space x have been doing pioneering work in bringing space closer to the masses. But real exploration, the one that touches millions of lives, takes tons of money and resources, something only governments are capable of funding. Mars mission is not just another step for us, it is a defining moment for us as an intelligent species. The astronauts who go to mars will embark on the greatest journey of discovery in the history of science. Will they find life? Will they find remains of something that resembles life? What is our place among the stars? Mars might actually answer perhaps the greatest question mankind has ever encountered since it attained consciousness. Are we alone?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>', '05-01.png;', '2019-10-06 03:51:18', '2019-10-06'),
(6, 'The WOW Signal', 'The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University\'s Big Ear radio telescope in the United States.', 'Anony', '<p>April 15<sup>th</sup>, 1977. &nbsp;It was an average summer\\\'s night, until Big Ear radio observatory of Ohio State University picked up what may have been an intentional message from an intelligent alien civilization from outside the solar system.</p>\r\n<p>Jerry Ehman, a volunteer for SETI, or the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, was scanning radio waves from space, hoping to come across any signs of extra-terrestrial life, when his measurements spiked. As the signal was recorded, he jumped out of his seat, exclaiming jubilantly. Soon, other scientists gathered around him, one even asked for the President! Amazed at the narrow range of frequency and the intensity of the signal, Jerry Ehman circled the data on the paper printout and wrote \\\"Wow!\\\" next to it. Hence, giving it the name - The wow signal.\r\n  <br>&nbsp;The signal appeared to have been transmitted from the Sagittarius constellation near a star called Tau Sagittarii, 120 light-years away. Its frequency was 1420.456 MHz and it lasted for 72 seconds. 1420 MHz is also known as the hydrogen line. Hydrogen, being the most abundant element in the universe, its frequency could be used by possible alien civilizations to make astronomical observations. The intensity of the signal rose and fell over the 72 second period, consistent with the rotation of the Earth. Only one of the two scope\\\'s recorded the signal. This could either be because the first scope recorded a signal which didn\\\'t exist, which is highly unlikely, or because the source of the signal was then shut off and redirected in another direction. This signal has the characteristics of what an expected transmitted signal should have.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Many people remain skeptical about the source of the signal. Despite all the signs indicating otherwise, they believe that the signal was not sent by aliens. Perhaps. But what if aliens do exist and what if it was sent by them, as a way of saying hello? Wow!\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>- Aliens living millions of light years away haven\\\'t invaded us yet in fear of dinosaurs that their telescopes show on Earth. :D\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>&nbsp;On an unrelated note, I thought that maybe we could add that. Though the one about dinosaurs may be a little mainstream now. ^\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br>\r\n</p>', '06-01.png;', '2019-10-06 04:35:40', '2019-10-06');
